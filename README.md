An educational app for young learners, ideal to be used with an interactive board.

This application was built with a MERN stack workflow.

- FRONT END => ReactJS
- BACK END => NodeJS -> ExpressJS -> MongoDB
- IMAGE STORAGE => https://cloudinary.com/

The game itself basically shows interactive flashcards, sorted out by english level and units.

Children can easily choose their favourite topic, touch cards and call the card name.

The back-end server allows users to login, create and store new classes and it is also integrated with an efficient cloud images storage API.

Once a new player will be registered, user can easily upload his picture which will be automatically cut in order to show just the player face, thruogh a face-recognition technology.
